\chapter{Related Work}

This section is the result of researching existing academic and commercial software systems and publications.
Since no prior systems with these requirements could be determined, related work was sought to cover subproblems
related to the design and implementation of such a system.

The section starts by the revision of three academic solutions with common goals with the proposed solution:
Arvika, Multi-User Tabletop Speech and Gestures and Digital Whiteboard.
An analysis is then conducted regarding input and output modalities capable of enabling such scenarios,
along with a set of shape creation and scene navigation techniques.
A comparative analysis of commercially available building modeling software is then conducted.
The section ends with the result of two interviews gathered with architects in order to survey
building characteristics and possible improvements over the common architectural work flow.
