This document presents an overview of the concept of creating urban scenery using multimodal interfaces.

% kind, nature, sort?
To build such a system one faces a series of problems. To allow creation and editing of scenery,
one needs to find a compromise between ease of use and expressiveness power.
Architecture conforms to a set of norms -- for the sake of beauty and balance of forms there are
parallelism, square angles, etc. The user would benefit from computer aid in conforming to these norms.
Finally, to achieve an immersive experience, navigation in the scenery must be fluid and not constrain the user.

Several solutions for the problems stated above are reviewed. A comparative analysis between products available
in the market which architects currently use to design buildings.

Finally, we state conclusions and point out directions for future work in this area.
