It became clear that all the components needed to make a multimodal system
for aiding architects in designing building sketches, navigating them and reviewing
them with clients is possible.

In order to develop such a system one has to carefully choose the best hardware
combination, interface metaphors and shape creation techniques and modalities in
use so the system becomes both powerful and easy to use.
Multimodal interfaces allow for more successful creative designs by offering a least intrusive
way of controlling the system. 

From the comparative analysis between commercial applications for this area,
an evolution can be seen in terms of ease of use and aiding tools offered by the most recent
packages, allowing a less experienced user to feel confident in small architecture tasks.
It is unfortunately evident that collaborative functionalities are mostly absent.
