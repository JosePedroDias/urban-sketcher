%\section{Context}

% need

With the advent of advanced visualization hardware it is now possible
to interact with complex representations of urban scenarios.
Systems capable of editing 3-dimensional content
tend to be overly complex and make use of concepts
focused on mouse and keyboard interaction.
There's a demand for systems capable of offering 3D scenes rendering
and supporting multi-user interaction on large screens on fields
so disparate as architecture and the entertainment industry.


% difficulty

Developing an application for such purposes requires dealing with several aspects
-- the large scale rendering of the scenario,
giving people means to interact with the screen,
allowing people to interact at the same time and
offering a simple interface adapted to the running environment.


% detail - laser / menu / gate interface

A different input device must be used, one being both portable and light.
The concurrent input of several users must be handled so that each user can
take the most from the large screen area.

As will be discussed on the following section, this system's interface was set
for large screen displays and laser pointers chosen as the main source of user input.
These decisions raise some issues.
A laser pointer can't be tracked while the light is not turned on,
so any clicking behaviors are hard to mimic, even because users can't be 
precise while unable to view the laser pointer's projection on the screen.
So, instead of the commonly used buttons and drop-down menus,
gates and ring menus will be introduced.
To better explore the available space on the screen,
menus can be invoked as needed by performing preset strokes on the screen (gestures).
In order to make use of the designed interface, an application with the
purpose of supporting the straightforward creation, navigation and reviewing of urban scenarios is designed.


% detail - common architecture creation workflow

The current most common work flow process for defining the location and overall shape
of a new building is a process comprised of several discrete steps.
The architect starts by drawing rough sketches of the desired building.
These are highly subjective, with clients having a hard time in their interpretation and validation.
The architect then proceeds on studying the best location and orientation for the building.
This step used to be performed by observing 2D maps and on-site examination.
Once the location and overall building shape are defined, a rigorous project is drawn using
Computer Aided Design (CAD) software such as Autodesk Autocad\cite{SITE-AUTOCAD}.
This design is performed from scratch.
If architects are required to subsequently showcase the building appearance,
they rely of pre-rendered images and animations.


% high-level description of solution

The proposed solution defines a system which allows architects to draft designs
directly on the 3D scene, allowing clients to better perceive the project at early stages
and empowering them with navigation and reviewing capabilities.
To accurately merge new buildings on the scenery one needs to obtain
satellite imagery and height maps of the landscape, a feasible task at present times.
Additional benefits could come later on by sharing the collected landscape information
with the CAD software and eventually exporting the draft buildings for reference.
Another benefit comes from getting a showcase platform for the project set up for free.
Instead of, or additionally to the set of pre-rendered images and short video clips,
clients now have at their disposal a real-time navigation platform which can be used
as a selling ad.


% novelty

This project takes advantage of large screen displays,
made possible by the devised interface based on gate activation and ring menus,
with users applying discrete strokes using laser pointers.
The navigation and shape creation functionalities are focused on simplicity and a set
of tools is set so additional scenarios and facade styles can be implemented.
An novel set of modeling tools and interaction gestures is put to work.
A new work flow is proposed so the system is used both at early design stages and
at showcasing the project.

The success of the project shall be measured against the fulfillment of the following goals:


\TODO{INSERT RESULT CONCLUSIONS HERE?, FALAR NO PASSADO}

\begin{description}
	\item[Good interface design] --
		The system works on large display screens using mostly laser pointers
		-- an additional voice command and arm gesture interface is offered for navigation.
		The average user has no experience with these environments.
		The system should be mastered by first-time users after a few minutes.
		The system should also make the best use of the input devices put to use.
		
	\item[Expressiveness of the system] --
		The project shall give users capabilities so that simple approximations can be generated.
		Tasks such as navigating the scene or attaching notes to objects ought to be of simple execution.
		Clients might also do small manipulations on the geometry or positioning of objects.
	
	\item[Filling the gap between architect and client] --
		Clients aren't used to visualizing the implicit model by the interpretation of 
		common architectural documents such as orthogonal views or cuts.
		They would surely benefit from 3D virtual approximations.
\end{description}

The system will be subject to usability tests in order to evaluate the fulfillment of these goals.
