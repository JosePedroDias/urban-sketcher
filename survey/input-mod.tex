Welch and Foxlin \cite{MT-BULLET} conducted a survey on motion tracking systems, comparing
each solution in terms of cost, precision and capacity to solve the tracking problem.
A group of purposes were identified as main motion tracking applications:
view control, navigation, object selection or manipulation, instrument tracking and avatar animation.

There are motion tracking systems based on measurements of mechanical, inertial, acoustic, magnetic,
optical and radio frequency sensors, each approach bearing its advantages and limitations.

The most robust solution is the combination of two technologies, such as a hybrid between
inertial and acoustic sensors -- the former is lightweight and providing 6 degrees of freedom
information but in time

\paragraph{Discussion}

One can envision the proposed solution to use motion tracking to allow users to change their
point of view in the program, navigate the scene, select and manipulate objects, a subset
of functionality identified by Welch and Foxlin.
