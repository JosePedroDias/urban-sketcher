The author would like to thank his supervisor, Professor Joaquim Jorge,
for his vision, creativity and guidance. You have given me confidence that everything
is possible and assisted me in achieving my goals.

Thanks are due to the rest of the portuguese IMPROVE team members Bruno Araújo,
Ricardo Jota and Luís Bruno. Our numerous brainstorming sessions and subsequent hard work paid off.

The author would also like to thank José António Gonçalves for taking part in the
motion tracking navigation mode and all the test users who volunteered both
for the Glasgow and Lisbon tests.

He would like to thank most of all his wife, parents and friends for all the support and understanding
given along this long journey -- I couldn't have made it without you!
