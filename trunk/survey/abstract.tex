% context and problem
Architects need to draft sketches of building designs prior to drawing
the final CAD documents in order to study viable designs and discuss them with clients.
This is currently done with pen and paper. One could offer architects an alternative
method to draw their sketches, one that models the buildings' drafts in 3D, allowing
editing shapes, navigating the scene and manipulating additional content,
such as annotations.

% purpose of the survey
The author is committed to develop such a system using currently available technology
and multimodal interfaces.

% summary of sections
The author identifies several problems and lists possible solutions for them.
A comparative analysis between architecture creation system available in the market
is then conducted.
Finally, conclusions are reached and directions for future work in this area defined.
