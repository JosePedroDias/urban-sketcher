  abstract = {In this paper we introduce an innovative application designed to make
	collaborative design review in the architectural and automotive domain
	more effective. For this purpose we present a system architecture
	which combines variety of visualization displays such as high resolution
	multi-tile displays, TabletPCs and head-mounted displays with innovative
	2D and 3D Interaction Paradigms to better support collaborative mobile
	mixed reality design reviews. Our research and development is motivated
	by two use scenarios: automotive and architectural design review
	involving real users from Page\Park architects and FIAT Elasis. Our
	activities are supported by the EU IST project IMPROVE aimed at developing
	advanced display techniques, fostering activities in the areas of:
	optical see-through HMD development using unique OLED technology,
	marker-less optical tracking, mixed reality rendering, image calibration
	for large tiled displays, collaborative tablet-based and projection
	wall oriented interaction and stereoscopic video streaming for mobile
	users. The paper gives an overview of the hardware and software developments
	within IMPROVE and concludes with results from first user tests.},
