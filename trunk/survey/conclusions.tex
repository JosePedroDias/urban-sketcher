There is interest in a solution that offers free form sketching for early stages of
design and with good navigational and reviewing capabilities.
The surveyed articles make it clear that it is nowadays feasible to build such a system.
A number of decisions must be made in order to develop such system, both in terms of
main purpose of the system, available hardware and facilities, number of users to serve
simultaneously and the precision vs freedom in sketching.

Multimodal interfaces allow for more successful creative designs by offering a least intrusive
way of controlling the system. Beautification improves user's ability to sketch geometrically.
3D reconstruction can be successfully accomplished for a given domain such as architecture
given a number of guidelines are respected. Suggestive interfaces allow the user to aid the
system in the interpretation task of forms.

The market offers a number of solutions for architecture design.
An evolution can be seen in terms of ease of use and aiding tools offered by the most recent
packages, allowing a less experienced user to feel confident in small architecture tasks.
